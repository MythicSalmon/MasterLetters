<h1>Master Letter 1</h1>
<h2>Emily Dickinson</h2>

<p>Dear Master <br><br>
  

    I am ill, but grieving more that you are ill, I make my stronger hand work long eno' to tell you. I thought perhaps you were in Heaven, and when you spoke again, it seemed quite sweet, and wonderful, and surprised me so - I wish that you were well. <br><br>
    
    I would that all I love, should be weak no more. The Violets are by my side, the Robin very near, and "Spring" - they say, Who is she - going by the door - <br><br>
    
    Indeed it is God's house - and these are gates of Heaven, and to and fro, the angels go, with their sweet postillions - I wish that I were great, like Mr. Michael Angelo, and could paint for you. You ask me what my flowers said - then they were disobedient - I gave them messages. They said what the lips in the West, say, when the sun goes down, and so says the Dawn. <br><br>
    
    Listen again, Master. I did not tell you that today had been the Sabbath Day
    <br><br>
    
    Each Sabbath on the Sea, makes me count the Sabbaths, till we meet on shore - and (will the) whether the hills will look as blue as the sailors say. I cannot talk any more (stay any longer) tonight (now), for this pain denies me. <br><br>
    
    How strong when weak to recollect, and easy, quite, to love. Will you tell me, please to tell me, soon as you are well.
    <br><br>
